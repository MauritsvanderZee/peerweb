# peerweb
peerweb is a (student) project management tool used at fontys sebi venlo.

peerweb is a project that has grown over time and does not meet any
serious software engineering standard, development process wise.
It is also my personal vehicle to get acquainted with php, so you will
find various programming style, some old, some new and some that
should not be followed in real projects. 
Nonetheless it contains some functionality that appears to be useful.

My maintenance strategy is completely open source style: If my back
needs scratching, I'll scratch, otherwise I leave things as is.

The project uses php and **PostgreSQL** as database.
I will not support any effort to replace the database by anything
else. PostgreSQL is perfect for the job and peerweb relies on some
functionality that PostreSQL provides out of the box.
